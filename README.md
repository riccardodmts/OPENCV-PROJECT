# Project for the CV university course

The aim of this project is to develop an algorithm capable of:

- detecting human hands in an input image
- segmenting human hands in the image from the background

We are allowed to use CNNs only to solve one of the two tasks (for instance we cannot use  Mask R-CNN). For this reason the solution is based on:

- YOLOv4 for object detection
- a specific algorithm described in the pdf (_report.pdf_)

To compile the program, follow the instructions reported in _report.pdf_ (first paragraph: Introduction). Before, you have to download the weights for YOLOv4 by using this link
